# Hackathon-2024

This is the repository of Hackathon 2024 project!

# Project overview

Our application, developed as part of the 2024 Hackathon, is designed to address the unique challenges faced by individuals with autism in social and communicative contexts. By leveraging advanced technology and innovative design, our project aims to enhance the way people with autism interact with the world around them, promoting greater understanding and inclusivity.

The backend, constructed using Flask, acts as the robust spine supporting our React-based frontend. Together, these technologies ensure a seamless and responsive user experience. Our platform offers tools and features specifically tailored to improve communication pathways, making everyday interactions more accessible and less stressful for individuals with autism and those who interact with them.
